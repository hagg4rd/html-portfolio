<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a flight attendant looking to get out of the airline industry and start working on creative projects through web development. I've always had a love for web development. I can think back to when I was in high school and I would spend the day after school in my teacher's classroom on her computer writing very basic HTML code just like I'm doing now</p>
<p>Although I may have gone down a different path for a bit, I'm happy to have found my way back to where I began. It's never too late to start over. I'm excited for what the future brings.</p>
<p>I am a huge gamer so a lot of my work will likely have some sort of video game influence put into it. That's the finishing touch to these projects. Thank you for stopping by.</p>
